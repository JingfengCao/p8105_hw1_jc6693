## Problem 1

### load library

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──

### load data

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

### short discription

This dataset contains variables of origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour. And it contains 358 rows and 15 columns. The mean temperature
is 39.5821229.

### scatterplot of temp vs time_hour

Draw a scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x) and save as
`scatterplot_temp_vs_time_hour.png`.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather,aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave('scatterplot_temp_vs_time_hour.png')
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

The patterns of this plot: The temp has periodically waves, which might
be because of high temperature during daytimes and low during nights.
During the time in this dataset, the temperature dropped to the lowest
and gradually increase in trend. After reaching the highest on about Jan
14, the temperature suddenly dropped and reached the similar level of
the beginning. The humid is high at a short time interval on and before
Jan 14, and is slightly high at some time point around Jan 07.

## Problem 2

Create the dataframe:

``` r
set.seed(12346789)
rnumber_x = rnorm(10)
problem2_df = tibble(
  rnumber_snd = rnumber_x,
  greater_0 = rnumber_x > 0,
  rchar = sample(letters,10,TRUE),
  rfactor = factor(sample(c('A','B','C'),10,TRUE),c('A','B','C'))
)
problem2_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    rnumber_snd greater_0 rchar rfactor
    ##          <dbl> <lgl>     <chr> <fct>  
    ##  1      1.04   TRUE      m     B      
    ##  2      0.0170 TRUE      g     C      
    ##  3     -1.20   FALSE     m     C      
    ##  4     -1.75   FALSE     j     B      
    ##  5      0.415  TRUE      r     A      
    ##  6      1.39   TRUE      c     B      
    ##  7     -1.28   FALSE     b     B      
    ##  8     -1.31   FALSE     a     B      
    ##  9      0.814  TRUE      l     A      
    ## 10      0.522  TRUE      g     A

try to take the mean:  
1. mean(rnumber_snd) = -0.1341687.  
2. mean(greater_0) = 0.6.  
3. mean(rchar) = NA.  
4. mean(rfactor) = NA.

the numeric and logical variables can successfully take the mean, and
the character and factor variables can not.

using `as.numeric` :

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df,greater_0))
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df,rchar))
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df,rfactor))
```

it is successful when dealing with logical variables and factor
variables. It can explain that in logical variables TURE equals 1 and
FALSE equals 0 when calculate mean. But factor variables can not
directly calculate mean though it has numbers represent to each level.
